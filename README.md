# Blackiimov Checker
## Description
A personal project. Fetches Steam market results for _AWP | Asiimov (Battle-Scarred)_ item and utilizes the CSGOFloat API to check each item; if the item's float is greater than 0.95 and the price is less than $100, it notifies the user.
## Setup
This script is written in Python3. The only module it utilizes that is not included with Python3 is `tqdm`, which can be installed with `pip install tqdm`.
## Usage
```python3 BlackiimovChecker.py``` :)
## Notes
This program was last modified in May 2021; upon testing more recently it does not appear to be working properly (I don't think Valve likes this kind of automated use of their market).

I will leave this repository up as a reference for future projects (lots of webpage parsing and regex stuff).
